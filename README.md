# Swift---Youtubechannel
First steps with Swift. 

Working with Master-Detail views for an Ipad application, using: split views, closures, api call, manage json files, loaders, search bar controls, NSUserDefaults.

By default the youtube channel is "Los carnavales de Cadiz". You could change it in the constant: "REQ_YOUTUBE_DEFAULT_NAME" and "REQ_YOUTUBE_DEFAULT_ID", from "Constans.swift". 

Next step: get the name and id of the youtube channel from the alert created from the master view (at the top of the main list).
